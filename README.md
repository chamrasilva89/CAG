Idea summary
Why we need this:

In today's fast-paced world, people are increasingly pressed for time and unwilling to invest significant effort in retrieving information, including navigating complex ERP screens or downloading lengthy reports. To address this challenge, we have introduced Chat and Get (CAG), an AI-driven application that can be accessed via Mobile application. Users can easily interact with CAG using voice or text commands and receive responses in the form of figures or easily understandable statements.

CAG functions as a smart ERP assistant, capable of performing critical workflow approvals through personal mobile devices from anywhere in the world. By leveraging CAG, users can enjoy the benefits of a miniature ERP system, making it an attractive option for customers. Additionally, the extended version of CAG can incorporate part of the Pronto XI ERP system for even greater functionality In the future.

How the data will be secured?

To ensure secure and reliable access to the database, we will utilize authenticated APIs. User privileges will be controlled through the CAG Authentication screen in the ERP system. From this screen, administrators can assign privileges for modules, screens, roles, and users, and add special controls on keywords to limit searches (e.g., profit, salary, DOB).

Where the AI is infused in Application:

One of the major benefits of AI is its ability to comprehend human language and convert questions into a format that is comprehensible by computer systems, including splitting questions into keywords to improve search reliability. The CAG AI system is particularly skilled at this task and excels at searching for the most accurate results while maintaining user privacy. Additionally, the system can provide reliable answers or warning messages, making it a valuable tool for users.

Who will be benefited from using CAG :

CAG is designed to benefit users of all levels, from beginners to experienced and high-level users.

Beginners can leverage CAG to quickly locate screens and obtain necessary information about ERP, such as how to reset passwords or set profile pictures.

Experienced users can use CAG to ask quick questions and feed data into other screens. For example, they can ask about today's exchange rate for USD.

High-level users who require rapid access to critical information and need to make quick decisions can also benefit from CAG. Additionally, CAG can be used by high-level approval users who may have limited time to log into the ERP system.
